#### Body Politic: Disability and Political Cohesion
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between a fifth and a quarter of Americans lives with some form of functional disability. Disability is an embodied characteristic and a complex social category with clear links to politics. Nevertheless, political scientists have only a superficial understanding of how disability shapes political behavior. In particular, whereas some work considers the impact of disability on political participation, almost no empirical work has examined the implications of disability for political *psychology*. My dissertation addresses this gap by examining whether and to what extent disability shapes political identity and cohesion among disabled Americans.  

Conventional wisdom in public opinion research suggests social identities become politically meaningful through processes of *mobilization*, either from the top-down by political elites, or via grassroots processes of intragroup contact and acculturation ([Egan 2012](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/egan.bjps.2012.pdf)). I argue that these processes are theoretically unlikely to apply to Americans with disabilities. Disabled Americans have been largely overlooked by partisan elites, and tend to lack the dense social networks that facilitate political mobilization from the grassroots. Addressing this gap, I ask: what social or political processes may contribute to a sense of political solidarity among disabled Americans? I argue that in the absence of conventional mobilization processes, disability may obtain political salience through exposure to ableist stigma and discrimination, and via processes of policy feedback that link disability to specific redistributive rights and entitlements. 

My job market paper addresses this question using data from two original national surveys of American adults with disabilities (total N = 1760) fielded by Forthright Panels, along with nationally representative data from the 2024 ANES Pilot Study. I derive a new empirical measure of subjective identification with disability - the Disability ID scale - and examine the implications of this identity for the political behavior and attitudes of Americans with disabilities. I find that Disability ID is strongest among those with more severe, visible, and long-standing impairments; among African-Americans, and among those who report receiving disability welfare or accommodations.
