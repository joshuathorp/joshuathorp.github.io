#### Project Summary
  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between a fifth and a quarter of Americans lives with some form of functional disability. Disability is an embodied characteristic and a complex social category with clear links to politics. Nevertheless, political scientists have only a superficial understanding of how disability shapes political behavior. In particular, whereas some work considers the impact of disability on political participation, almost no empirical work has examined the implications of disability for political psychology. My dissertation addresses this gap by examining the role of disability in shaping the political identities of disabled Americans.

Conventional wisdom in public opinion research suggests social identities become politically meaningful through processes of mobilization - either from the top-down by political elites, or via grassroots processes of intragroup contact and acculturation. However, I argue these processes are largely inapplicable to disabled Americans. Unlike other social minorities, disabled people have not been mobilized by partisan elites, and tend to lack the dense social networks that facilitate political mobilization from the grassroots. This raises an important question: what kinds of social or political processes, if any, may contribute to a sense of political solidarity among disabled Americans? 

My dissertation project addresses this question using new theory and data from three original national surveys of American adults with disabilities, and nationally representative data from the 2024 ANES Pilot Study. I argue that even in the absence of conventional mobilization processes, disability may become politically salient through exposure to disability-related stigma and discrimination, and through processes of policy feedback that link disability to legal rights and redistributive entitlements. I find that Disability ID is closely associated with impairment characteristics and experiences of socialization into disability-related social and political institutions. Moreover, I find that identification with disability is strongly associated with a range of political attitudes and identities, including partisanship, ideological self-placement, and policy preferences. Taken together, these findings provide robust evidence that disability is an important dimension of political identification.
