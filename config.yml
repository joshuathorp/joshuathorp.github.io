          subtitle: 
              I am a PhD candidate in political science (American politics) at the University of Michigan, specializing in public opinion, political psychology, and public policy. In Fall 2025, I will be Assistant Professor of Public Opinion at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. <br><br> 

              I conduct research in public opinion and political psychology in advanced democracies. My dissertation and book project examines the role of political processes - such as policy feedback, experience of stigma and discrimination, and exposure to protest action - in shaping the political attitudes and behavior of Americans with Disabilities <br><br>

              My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals including *Political Psychology* and the *Journal of Experimental Political Science*, and is supported by the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust, the Rapoport Family Foundation, the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan, and Time-Sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences (TESS).
