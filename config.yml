          subtitle: 
              Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in political science (American politics) at the University of Michigan. My research sits at the intersection of public opinion, political psychology, and public policy. I am particularly interested in how public policies promote political engagement and create conditions for collective action among members of social minority groups. My dissertation project draws on data from original national surveys and experiments to examine the role of disability in shaping the political identities of disabled Americans.<br><br> 
              
              In addition to my doctoral research, I have several ongoing projects examining public attitudes toward redistributive and social policy in the United States and other advanced democracies. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals including *Political Psychology* and the *Journal of Experimental Political Science*. More information about my dissertation and other research projects can be found at the links below.<br><br>  
              
              I am affiliated with the Center for Political Studies at the Institute for Social ​Research (ISR). I am a recipient of the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Grant, the ​Rapoport Family Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Grant, the Gerald R. Ford Fellowship, ​and the Converse-Miller Fellowship in American Political Behavior. <span style="color:#011F5B">**I am on the job market in 2024-25**</span>.
