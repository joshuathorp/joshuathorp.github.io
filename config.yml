          subtitle: 
              Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in political science (American politics) at the University of Michigan, specializing in public opinion, political psychology, and public policy. My dissertation project draws on data from original national surveys and experiments to examine the role of political processes - such as policy feedback, experiences of stigma and discrimination, and exposure to protest action - in shaping the political identities of Americans with disabilities.<br><br> 
              
              In addition to my doctoral research, I have several ongoing projects in political psychology and public policy in the United States and other advanced democracies. I am particularly interested in how intergroup prejudice and stereotypes shape attitudes toward social policy. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals including *Political Psychology* and the *Journal of Experimental Political Science*.<br><br>  
              
              At Michigan, I am affiliated with the Center for Political Studies at the Institute for Social ​Research (ISR). I am a recipient of the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Grant, the ​Rapoport Family Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Grant, the Gerald R. Ford Fellowship, ​and the Converse-Miller Fellowship in American Political Behavior. <span style="color:#011F5B">**I am on the job market in 2024-25**</span>.
